# The python code consists of three parts
1. Code to solve 3D-knapsack problem, which is called 3dKnapsackFinal.py
2. Code to solve the MILP model, which is TSP.py
3. Code to visualize the result, which is draw_graph.py
# The R code includes all Generized Linear Models and can be found in the folder RegressionWithR
# In order to run the TSP.py, you have to download Lindo python Api
# The thesis can be downloaded through Thesis_Can.pdf
